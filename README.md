# Synthesis of Adversarial samples in Two-stage Classifiers

Below is a guide for the scripts used to reproduce results of table(s) and figure(s) of the submitted paper to ICASSP 2022.

Follow the python files names for the types of attacks on the paper. Targeted labels are chose in a random way and fixed for fair comparison.

The experiments are conducted using Python 3 on Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700 CPU @ 3.60GHz machine.

While the experiments are run in python, the generated data are converted to .mat files for the figures. The data used in this work are in the Data Folder.
